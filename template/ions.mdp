; ions.mdp - Energy minimization after ion addition

; Algorithm and stopping criteria
integrator  = steep         ; Steepest descent minimization
emtol       = 1000.0        ; Stop minimization when max force < 1000 kJ/mol/nm
emstep      = 0.01          ; Minimization step size
nsteps      = 50000         ; Maximum number of steps

; Neighbor searching and cutoffs
nstlist         = 5         ; Update neighbor list every 10 steps
cutoff-scheme   = Verlet    ; Buffered neighbor searching
ns_type         = grid      ; Grid-based neighbor search
coulombtype     = cutoff       ; Particle Mesh Ewald for electrostatics cutoof / PME
rcoulomb        = 1.2       ; Electrostatic cutoff (1.2 nm, matching production)
rvdw            = 1.2       ; Van der Waals cutoff (1.2 nm, matching production)

; Constraints and Periodic Boundary Conditions
pbc             = xyz       ; Apply periodic boundary conditions in all directions
constraints     = none      ; No constraints during energy minimization
